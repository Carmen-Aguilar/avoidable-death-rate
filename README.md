# Avoidable mortality higher in deprived areas

I published this story [Avoidable death 32% higher in the West Midlandsâ€™ most deprived cities](http://birminghameastside.com/2018/07/19/avoidable-death-west-midlands-most-deprived-cities/) on 19th July after an analysis with figures shared by the BBC Shared Data Unit. 

The R Notebook with the explanation of the analysis for the West Midlands and the interactive charts can be found [here.](http://rpubs.com/Carmen_Aguilar/correlation-and-funnelplot)
